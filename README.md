[# ME](me.md)
I'm an autodidact learner and designer enthusiast. My aim is to transform practical design into solutions to social problems in my community.
I firmly believe that design applied as a holistic method of thinking offers an objective yet integrative appraoch to adding value to a service, product or goal.

# üé≤ Why I design? 
[First I thought of 'design' as the solution to my society's problems](why-i-design-2.md)

[Second, design for practial means.](why-i-design-1.md)

Synthesis: 
If you ever ask me what is design, I'll tell you it's everything.
